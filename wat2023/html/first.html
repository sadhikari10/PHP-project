        <h3>Text Formatting</h3>
        <p>A paragraph with <em>some words that are emphasized</em> and <strong>some important 
            words.</strong> Followed by some<mark> highlighted words</mark>.
             Feel free to add any other text formatting that appelas to you.</p>
            <pre style="font-family:courier; text-align:left;">    This is some text 
    that is laid out exactly as 
    Laid out at code level without any additional
    markup </pre>

        <h3>Special Characters</h3>
        <p>The browser thinks &lt; is a programming character. Also &gt;. The browser also ignores any 
        line breaks <br> in your code and any &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka htmlk character entities.
    There are other entities available such as &pound; and &amp;   </p>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You 
        can have linksto separate sites such as<a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> Leeds Beckett.</a> 
        Links to other pages of the<a href="second.html"> same site.</a> Links to another point in the<a href="#Fundamentals"> same page. </a>
    </p>
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <div class="imgcontainer">
        <img src="Gift.jpg" alt="image of gift" style="width:100px;height:100px;" >
    </div>

    <p>This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder</p>
    <p>I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers.</p>
    <p>Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the W3C
        Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right click
         on your page and chose inspcet or view source you can check your code and 
         see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag
